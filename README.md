Deep Learning for Financial Time Series (NVIDIA stock example)
The objective of this research is to predict the short-term directional movement of NVIDIA Corporation's common stock (NVDA). Utilizing daily trading data from August 15, 2019, to August 14, 2024, I aim to discern whether the stock will experience an upward or downward movement on the following trading day. By integrating a broad array of financial and trading metrics into a predictive model, I seek to provide a robust tool for traders and financial analysts to forecast stock movements more accurately.
This investigation not only involves the development of a sophisticated model using historical price data and financial ratios but also focuses on enhancing the model's accuracy through advanced feature engineering. This includes the examination of price movements, trading volumes, and various financial indicators that collectively offer insights into the stock's financial health and market behavior.
My approach is grounded in rigorous data analysis, beginning with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis to identify correlations and potential anomalies within the data. This is followed by meticulous data cleaning, feature selection, and model training, employing modern machine learning techniques to refine my predictive accuracy.
